# Log_file_analysis_tool
In this repository, I made a project in "BASH SHELL SCRIPTING " in Linux , in which you can play with commands and find out some stuff from Log files. 
NOTE:
----------
1. Open Linux terminal
2. write command "nano example.sh"
3. write complete code the press "ctrl+s"(save file) + "ctrl+x"(exit )
4. give permissions "chmod 777 example.sh"

you should run file in **ROOT USER**
